By design, this is built purely in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with no boilerplate. 

The point of this whole thing?
1) Demonstrate what I know by showcasing other projects of mine
2) Give you the very experience of this site itself to highlight my obession with UX
3) Make it frictionless to get in touch with me
4) Have a lil fun with it!
